Excavation README:

The excavation app takes regular and 3d photos, and writes them to a database.

Main screen: SplashMainScreen.java
	SplashMainScreen connects to the database, then launches BaseActivity and MainActivity simultaneously.

Other activities: BaseActivity.java
	Several activities extend BaseActivity to add an overflow and menu. In the top right corner, the user can change the server's IP address.
The settings overflow also contains an option "Image Property", which when selected launches ActivityImageProperty. Several activities extend
BaseActivity, which adds a menu to the bottom of the screen and action overflow at the top. At the bottom of the screen, the user can tap 
"Context" to launch MainActivity, "3d" to launch Activity3d, or tap Sample to launch ActivitySample.

ActivityImageProperty.java
	ActivityImageProperty allows the user to change various properties of captured images. The user can change the 3d image subpath, regular
image subpath, context subpath, sample label area divider, sample label context divider, sample label font, sample label font size, sample label
sample divider, and sample subpath through corresponding textboxes. The user can change the sample label location through a spinner. Finally, the
user can press Update Property to confirm their changes and launch SampleActivity.

MainActivity.java
	MainActivity allows the user to update the image of objects in the database. Once the database connects and loads easting and northing data,
the user can select the object through the easting and northing spinners. Once selected, the latest picture of the object is displayed in the
middle of the screen. At the top of the screen, the user can press "Replace Photo" to launch ActivityCamera. Upon pressing "Next Photo" another
instance of MainActivity is launched, this one corresponding to the next photo.

Activity3d.java
	3dActivity allows the user to take photos of an object to use as placeholder photos for all objects in that area. The user can select a
northing and easting through spinners at the top of the screen. All matching artifacts are displayed in a grid in the middle of the screen. The
user can press "Take Next Photo" to launch ActivityCamera1 and take a picture of the object. Pressing "Upload All" launches
MultiPhotoSelectActivity.

ActivitySample.java
	SampleActivity allows the user search for a sample in the database. The spinners at the top correspond to object easting, northing, material,
context number, and sample number. As each is entered, the matching objects in the database are displayed in a grid in the middle of the screen.
The user can select an object and tap "Take Photo" to launch ActivityCamera1.

ActivityCamera.java
	CameraActivity allows the user to take a picture of an artifact.

ActivityCamera1.java
	Camera1Activity allows the user to take a picture for all artifacts with a specified easting and northing. It launches Activity3d upon finishing.

MultiPhotoSelectActivity.java
	MultiPhotoSelectActivity allows the user to select the artifacts whose picture should be updated with that taken from ActivityCamera1.
