WiDaC README:

The WiDaC app communicates with a reflex scale over the phone's Bluetooth and writes the measured weights to the database.

Main Screen: SplashActivity.java
	SplashActivity quickly displays the splash logo then launches MainActivity.

Other Activities: MainActivity.java
	MainActivity prompts the user to query the database for a particular artifact. The user can either use a series of spinners to select a pre-loaded item
or manually search for one using a series of textboxes. Once either the textboxes or spinners are filled out (precedence resolved in that order) and the user
presses "Search", the user is taken to SearchActivity. Below "Search", if the user presses "Settings" they are taken to SettingsActivity. If the user presses
"Visualization", they are taken to VisualizationActivity, and below that if the user presses "Session Report", they are taken to SessionReportActivity.

SearchActivity.java
	SearchActivity displays a picture of the artifact, and below it displays its most recent weight taken. At the top of the screen, the user can cycle through
the registered weights using the "PREV" and "NEXT" buttons, as well as switch to a different artifact by selecting a different Northing, Easting, Context
Number, and Sample Number through another series of spinners. At the bottom are two buttons allowing the user to add a new weight either through reading directly
from the scale over Bluetooth or manual entry.

SettingsActivity.java
	SettingsActivity displays the currently connected bluetooth scale and the database URL to connect to when the service is running. Below are a list of all
paired Bluetooth devices (not necessarily scales) that the user can tap to connect to. The "Pair New Device" button launches Android's native Bluetooth screen
to connect to a new device.

VisualizationActivity.java
	VisualizationActivity displays information about the artifacts stored in the database.

SessionReportActivity.java
	SessionReportActivity displays the # collected, average size, average weight, and standard deviations of the glass, ceramic, metal, stone, and organic artifacts
registered.

Used APIs/External Libraries:
	VisualizationActivity uses com.github.mikephil.charting to generate a pie chart of the artifacts.
